What does REST mean? 
REpresentational
State
Transfer

The client server architecture

Client  ->   Server 

The client makes a request to the server which the server then checks to see if it is valid then either gives an error or accepts the request and gives something back.

The request from the client is an HTTP/HTTPS (secure) request.

There are also FTP (file transfer protocall) request. 

You must submit the correct request type to get a response. 

HTTPS is different than HTTP because it is masked by a hash function.

After the request is made the server sends back a page, a file, etc. 

The request is processed by the server but the server can get information from a database. The server can only do a fixed number of things. The server may also have an API which acts as a intermediate step between the server and the client which defines which request can be made to the server. 

REST is a architectural style used to make APIs. There are other styles as well.

RESTful API rules:
1. Use HTTP request verbs
2. Use specific pattern of routes/endpoint URLs.

The HTTP verbs
Get, Post, Put, Patch, and Delete

Similar to CRUD:
Create, read, update, delete.

Get is similar to Read in CRUD. It searches through the API and returns some kind of data.

Post is similar to create. It adds an entry to our API just like create adds data to our database. 

Put and Patch are similar to update, they update and entry in our API or database.

- a PUT request updates by REPLACING the entire entry. A patch request updates by updating the portion of the entry point that you want to be fixed (A single piece of data in the entry is replaced).

Delete is the same as delete, it removes a specified piece of data.

RESTful routing

HTTP Verbs         /articles             /articles/1
GET            Fetches all articles     Fetches 1 article 
POST           Creates one article 
PUT                                     Replaces article 1
PATCH                                   Updates article 1 
DELETE         Deletes all articles     Deletes article 1
